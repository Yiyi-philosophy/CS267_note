## P1:

Note:
1. load imbalance = inefficient
2. Simple parallel problem: : dividing big problem to many processors.
3. Classification of HPC:

    1. **SMP**: Shared Memory or Multicore
    2. **HPC**: High performance Computing or distribute memory
    3. **SIMD**: Single Instruction Multiple Data
4. Different between **Concurrency** & **Parallelism** : logical & actual
5. **Goal**: Exa-flop = 10^18 flop/s
6. Top 500 Project

    1. Yardstick: Linpack -> Solve $Ax=b$
7. Performance history and Protection
8. **Gordon Bell Prize**: Application Performance 
9. **Five paradigm**: Theory & Experiment & Simulation & Data Analysis & Machine Learning
10. Analytics & Simulation
	- **7 Giants of Data:** Basic statics & Generalized N-Body & Graph-theory & Linear algebra & Optimizations & Integrations & Alignment
	- **7 Dwarfs of Simulation**:  Monte Carlo method & Particle methods & Unstructured meshes & Dense Linear Algebra & Sparse Linear Algebra &  Spectral methods &  Structured Meshes.
11. Limitation of HPC: 
    - Space limitation: Single Chip :  
        - $r<c/10^{12}$
    - Heat limitation: $Power \propto  V^2fC$
12. Reinterpreted Moore's law

## P2

### Performance programming on uniprocessors requires 

- Understanding of memory system
  - Processor: variable, operation, control
  - Mem hierarchy: On chip cache > SRAM > DRAM > DISK >Cloud
    - Temporal & Spatial **locality**
  - Caches
  - Latency & Bandwidth

- Understanding of fine-grained parallelism in processor  
  - Pipeline 
  - **SIMD** & **FMA**

### Simple performance models can aid in understanding 

-  Two ratios are key to efficiency (relative to peak) 

1. Computational intensity of the algorithm:  
   - q = f/m = # floating point operations / # slow memory references 

2. Machine balance in the memory system:  
   - tm/tf = time for slow memory reference / time for floating point operation 

### Want $q > t_m/t_f$ to get half machine peak 

- Matrix Multiplication:
  - Naive: $q=f/m=2n^3/(n^3+3n^2) \approx  2$
  - Block: $q=f/m=2n^3/((2N+2)\times n^2)\approx n/N=b$

### Blocking (tiling) is a basic approach to increase q 

- Techniques apply generally, but the details (e.g., block size) are architecture dependent 
- Similar techniques are possible on other data structures and algorithms
- Optimize in Practice
  - Matrix Storage
  - Copy Optimization
  - Loop Unrolling
  - Removing False Dependency
  - Exploit Multiple registers
  - Minimize Pointer Updates
